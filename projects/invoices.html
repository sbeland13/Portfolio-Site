                  <p>This is a simple Rails application that I put together to demonstrate successful deployment of a useful application to AWS. With this invoice generator, a user can enter all of their company and client information, the itemized cost breakdown, currency, tax, date as well as terms and conditions. They can then print the invoice directly from the browser. Future additions will include user authentication, pdf conversion, direct email capability as well as payment integration with paypal and/or stripe.</p>
